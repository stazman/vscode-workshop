<!-- One reason VSCode is used by more developers than any other IDE is because of the vast number of extensions that are available (and the ease with which you can make your own!). There are literally hundreds of extensions. Here are some of the most common and useful: -->


<!-- To use any extension’s features:

      Open the command palette (try using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P/Cmd + P).

      Type > (Shift + .). This symbol is most commonly called a "greater than symbol" but technically is a "right angle bracket". Then start typing the name of the extension (though with some extensions like Prettier, you don’t type the name of the extension first).

-->

<!--

  Install each extension below by clicking on the Extension button on the Explorer sidebar to the left of VSCode, searching for the extension in the search bar at top, find the exact extension name, make sure it's the correct extension from the number of downloads shown to the right of the name (should be more than a few thousand for it to be one that's worth trying, usually), and then click "Install". You can also find extensions by Googling the name of it and "VSCode".

-->


<!-- Code Spell Checker -->

<!-- This extension will help you catch typos in your code. -->

  <!-- EXTENSION TASK 1: Use Code Spell Checker to spell check this page. -->


  <!-- Rename Auto Tags -->

<!-- This extension will help you rename the closing as well as beginning HTML tag of a pair of tags automatically. -->

  <!-- EXTENSION TASK 2: Use Rename Auto Tags to rename the <div> tags after the <nav> section to <main> . -->


<!-- htmltagwrap -->

<!-- While VSCode already lets you highlight code and wrap it with punctuation such as parentheses and quotation marks, you need an extension to wrap code with HTML tags. This extension does that. -->

  <!-- EXTENSION TASK 3: Wrap one of the lines of placement text ("lorem ipsum..l") in <p> tags. -->


<!-- We'll address these if we have time: -->
