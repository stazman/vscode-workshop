As developers, we're always seeking ways to optimize not only the applications we're working on but also our own workflows and practices. 

This repo shows some of the best VSCode keyboard shortcuts, settings, and extensions I've used to improve my efficiency and experience as a developer.


## Directions

After forking and cloning this repo, follow the directions in each HTML doc for practice. On each HTML page, there is a commented-out explanation of each shortcut, setting, or extension and then a task for you to practice it in place, directly in the file.
