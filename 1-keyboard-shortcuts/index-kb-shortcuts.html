      <!-- 1. Without typing any symbols first, you can use the command palette textbox to access files in an open project with just the keyboard. This is very useful if you have many files in your project. -->

      <!-- 2. If you use an @ (at symbol, asperand) in the command palette textbox, you can go to specific keywords, class names, and properties located in the currently open file. This is very useful if you have a lot of code in a file. -->

      <!-- 3. If you use a > (Shift + .)(most commonly called a "greater than symbol" but technically is a "right angle bracket"), you can access extension features. To access extension features, then start typing the name of the extension (though with some extensions like Prettier, you don’t type the name of the extension first. -->

  <!-- NOTE: We'll use the command palette extensively in the extensions part of this workshop. -->
