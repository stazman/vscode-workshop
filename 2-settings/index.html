Check out the Settings: Ctrl/Cmd + , (comma)

Note: be sure you choose “User” (the default) for general settings across all VSCode workspaces/projects/files, or “Workspace” if it’s just for the workspace. A VSCode workspace is different from just an open project directory. Workspaces are a way to contain different directories and files for a specific purpose or project. I wouldn’t bother using workspaces unless you have to.


Auto Save — The default in VSCode has auto save disabled. There are two ways to enable it:

Click on File in the toolbar and choose “Auto Save”

Open settings (Ctrl/Cmd + , (comma)) then type “auto save”. At the top of the main view area, you’ll see a dropdown that shows “off”. Choose “afterDelay”.

You can configure autosave in different ways in the same settings view, too, such as how long of a delay there is before changes are autosaved.
