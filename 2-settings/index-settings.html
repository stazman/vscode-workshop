<!-- Let's check out some important settings! -->

	<!-- NOTE: There are literally hundreds of different settings in VSCode, so if you need to change something substantially in the way your VSCode installation is configured, you can likely find a way to do it in Settings. -->

<!-- SETTINGS TASK 1: Use the Settings Keyboard Shortcut -- Ctrl/Cmd + , (comma) -->

	<!-- Note: be sure you choose “User” (the default) for general settings across all VSCode workspaces/projects/files, or “Workspace” if it’s just for the workspace. A VSCode workspace is different from just an open project directory. Workspaces are a way to contain different directories and files for a specific purpose or project. Try them out, but many developers find them to be more trouble than they're worth'. -->


<!-- SETTINGS TASK 2: Try Autosave if you haven't already. This is the only thing in this workshop I'm highly opinionated about. Some developers still like to save a file manually, but if you happen to forget to do that, it just wastes time and mental focus as you realize you just forgot to hit "save", and I see developers do it, especially beginning developers, all the time. Plus, there is no safety reason to use "save" manually. If you make a mistake with Autosave, you just have to undo it (Ctrl/Cmd + Z), or if it's in a file that you've closed, you can quickly undo changes in the "Source Control" (git) section of the Explorer Bar (the left sidebar in VSCode).

	The default in VSCode has auto save disabled. There are two ways to enable it: -->

	<!-- 1. Click on File in the toolbar and choose “Auto Save” -->

	<!-- 2. Open settings(Ctrl/Cmd + , (comma)) then type “auto save”. At the top of the main view area, you’ll see a dropdown that shows “off”. Choose “afterDelay”. -->

	<!-- NOTE: You can configure autosave in different ways in the same settings view, too, such as how long of a delay there is before changes are autosaved. -->

<!-- When you open Settings, it immediately goes to the Common Settings sidebar option. You should see what other options there are and then take a few minutes and go through the Common Settings settings to see what's available. -->

	<!-- SETTINGS TASK 3: Choose how many spaces make up a tab. Two spaces is the most common and is more easily readable unless accessibility needs require you to choose more spaces. -->

	<!-- SETTINGS TASK 4: Start typing "word wrap" or scroll down and set Word Wrap to "on" -->

<!-- NOTE: There are many settings related to accessibility located in the Commonly Used option in case you need them. -->
